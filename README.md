# Aadhar Card Registration System

This project is a simple web application for Aadhar card registration.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>

   cd aadhar-card-registration-system

## Running the Application
Start the backend server:
bash

# Inside the backend directory
npm start
This will start the backend server on port 3000 by default.
Start the frontend development server:
bash

# Inside the frontend directory
npm start
This will start the frontend development server and automatically open the application in your default web browser.

## Features

- User registration form
- Aadhar card generation with unique UID
- Display generated Aadhar card

## Technologies Used

- Frontend:
  - React.js
  - Axios for HTTP requests
  - React Router for routing
- Backend:
  - Node.js with Express.js
- Database: (You can mention the database you're using if applicable)

## Backend Functionalities

### Unique UID Generation

The backend server generates a unique UID (Unique Identification Number) for each Aadhar card registration. This UID is generated using a combination of random bytes generated by the crypto module in Node.js.

```javascript
// utils/uidGenerator.js

const crypto = require('crypto');

const uidSet = new Set();

const generateUID = () => {
  const uid = crypto.randomBytes(8).toString('hex');
  return uid;
};

const isUIDUnique = (uid) => {
  if (uidSet.has(uid)) {
    return false;
  }
  uidSet.add(uid);
  return true;
};

module.exports = { generateUID, isUIDUnique };

##Registration Endpoint
The backend provides a POST endpoint /api/register for registering users and generating Aadhar cards. When a user submits their details through the registration form, the backend generates a unique UID, creates an Aadhar card object with the user's details, and sends back the UID and Aadhar card as a response.

// routes/registrationRoutes.js

const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const { generateUID, isUIDUnique } = require('../utils/uidGenerator');

router.post('/register', async (req, res) => {
  const { fullName, dateOfBirth, address, contactInfo } = req.body;

  // Generate a unique UID
  let uid;
  do {
    uid = generateUID();
  } while (!isUIDUnique(uid));

  // Create the Aadhar card object
  const aadharCard = {
    uid,
    fullName,
    dateOfBirth,
    address,
    contactInfo,
  };

  // Store the UID and user data (e.g., in a database)
  // Here, you would typically save the aadharCard object and UID to a database

  res.json({ uid, aadharCard });
});

module.exports = router;
